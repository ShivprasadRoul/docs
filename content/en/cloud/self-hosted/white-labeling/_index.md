  Customize the appearance and branding of your engineering platform powered by Layer5 Cloud. 
---

You can change the logo, color scheme, domain name, and other aspects of the user interface to match your own identity and preferences. White-labeling enables you to offer a seamless and consistent experience to your customers, partners, or internal users who access your service mesh platform. White-labeling also helps you to differentiate your platform from other Layer5 Cloud users and competitors, and to enhance your brand recognition and loyalty.

## Customizing Themes

The Layer5 Cloud dashboard can be customized with your own branding, including your full-sized logo, logo mark, and color scheme. Customized theme colors also affect email notifications.

### Enable White Labeling: Organization Preferences

Layer5 Cloud supports customizing themes on a per organization basis. This includes the ability to upload your own logo and define your own color scheme. Your logo will be displayed in the top left corner of the dashboard. Both a full-sized logo and a logo mark are supported.

As an [Organization Administrator](/cloud/security/roles/organization-roles/), you can add your organization's logo to the global navigation bar, which supports a large, horizontal logo for desktop users and a small, square logo for mobile users. The logo appears at the top of each user's window for all Layer5 Cloud pages within your organization.

### Custom Logos

You can upload your own logo for your organization. Logo appears in upper left corner of all Layer5 Cloud pages. All teams, workspaces, and users in your organization will use these custom logos.

Your custom logos will optionally be visible to external users if you choose to customize your login screen. Otherwise, your custom logos will only be visible to users within your organization.

If you use a mobile device, the logo mark will be visible.

#### Logo Image Requirements

Logo images must be either in SVG, PNG or GIF format. GIF images can be animated, but are not recommended given their distraction to users. The maximum file size for each image is 500 KB.
<pre>
Horizontal logo: 389 width x 32 height pixels
</pre>
If you upload a smaller or larger image, the image is resized to exactly 389 x 32 pixels. If the aspect ratio does not match, then the image will be distorted. For example, a 132 x 132 pixel image expands to 389 x 32 pixels, causing distortion.

<!-- Insert example logo here -->
<pre>
Square logo (mark):  32 width x 32 height pixels
</pre>
{{% card header="Square Logo Example" footer="<i>Example: CNCF branding on Dashboard</i>" %}}
<p>
This example includes a custom branding with colors and logo mark as would be displayed on a mobile device.</p>

Each of the prebuilt widgets can be added to a dashboard only once. If find that a particular widget that you would like to have is not available, [please let us know](https://layer5.io/company/contact).

## Custom Domain Name and Login Screen

Layer5 Cloud supports customizing the login screen based on custom domain name. Redirect your users to your own domain name. For example, if your domain name is `mycompany.com`, you can redirect users to `meshery.mycompany.com`.

A subdomain is the part of a URL before the root domain. You can configure your subdomain as www or as a distinct section of your site, like hub.cncf.io.

Subdomains are configured with a CNAME record through your DNS provider.

### Configuring a subdomain

To set up a www or custom subdomain, such as `www.example.com` or `meshery.example.com`, you must add your domain in the repository settings. After that, configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider.

In Layer5 Cloud, navigate to your Provider Organization.

Under your Organization name, click Edit. If you cannot click the "Edit" action, verify that you are a [Provider Administrator](/cloud/security/roles).

Under "Custom domain", type your custom domain, then click Save. This will create a server configuration will require a reboot in order to take affect.

*Note: If your custom domain is an internationalized domain name, you must enter the Punycode encoded version.*

Navigate to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points your subdomain to the default domain for your site. For example, if you want to use the subdomain `hub.cncf.io` for your user site, create a CNAME record that points `hub.cncf.io` to `cloud.layer5.io`. For more information about how to create the correct record, see your DNS provider's documentation.

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
Warning: We strongly recommend that you do not use wildcard DNS records, such as `*.example.com`. These records put you at an immediate risk of domain takeovers, even if you verify the domain. For example, if you verify example.com this prevents someone from using `a.example.com`, but they could still take over `b.a.example.com` (which is covered by the wildcard DNS record).
{{< /alert >}}

#### Verifying your custom domain

Open Terminal.

To confirm that your DNS record configured correctly, use the dig command, replacing `hub.cncf.io` with your subdomain.

<pre>
$ dig WWW.EXAMPLE.COM +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
> ;hub.cncf.io.                    IN      A
> hub.cncf.io.             3592    IN      CNAME   .
> meshery.layer5.io.      43192    IN      CNAME   meshery.layer5.io .
> meshery.layer5.io .        22    IN      A       192.0.2.1
</pre>

## White Label FAQ

Frequently asked questions about white labeling.

**Do users have to use my custom URL to access the Organization?**
No. In addition to your custom URL, you'll always be able to log in from our website and access your Organization from <https://cloud.layer5.io>.

**When I send someone a link that includes my custom URL, do they need to be logged in?**
Yes. Users will need to be signed in through your custom URL (not through cloud.layer5.io) in order to open links that include your custom URL. Users who are not logged in can quickly do so, and subsequently, be redirected to the link you have shared.
